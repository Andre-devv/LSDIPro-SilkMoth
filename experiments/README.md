### Running the Experiments

To run the experiments, ensure the following:

1. Set the `SILKMOTH_DATA_PATH` environment variable, or provide the path to the data folder directly in the `run` function declaration (`Experiments("path")`).

2. The data folder can be found in the project wiki.

Alternatively, and more practical, you can use pre-extracted sets by downloading them.

1. For webtable experiments download pre-extracted sets from [here](https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/QSkFBfCTXgdSern). 
Place them in the `data\webtables` folder.
