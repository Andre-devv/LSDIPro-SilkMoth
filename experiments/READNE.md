### Running the Experiments

To run the experiments, ensure the following:

1. Set the `SILKMOTH_DATA_PATH` environment variable, or provide the path to the data folder directly in the `run` function declaration (`Experiments("path")`).

2. The data folder can be found in the project wiki.

3. Alternatively, and more practical, you can use pre-extracted sets by downloading them from [this link](https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/6eopZTJkcKYH5b2). Place the downloaded files into the `data` folder.
